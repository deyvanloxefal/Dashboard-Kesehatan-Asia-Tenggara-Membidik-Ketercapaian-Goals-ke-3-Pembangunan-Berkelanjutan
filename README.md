## Southeast Asia Health Dashboard: Aiming to Achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)
In this project, my group and I were assigned to work on a major project in the Data and Information Visualization course. To complete this project, we aimed to develop a data visualization focused on achieving Goal 3 in Southeast Asia, specifically to address Maternal Mortality, Non-Communicable Disease Mortality, and Primary Health Care. The region faces significant health and well-being challenges, which requires an in-depth understanding of these issues. This background motivated the development of the dashboard to provide clear insights into the state of health in Southeast Asia, serving as a basis for policy planning and mobilizing concerted efforts towards sustainable development goals.
